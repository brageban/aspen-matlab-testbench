# Notes

- BIDIR2_1 (SIMPLE_7_1): Base model
- BIDIR2_2 (SIMPLE_7_2): mod BIDIR2_1... 40% feed disturbance. LCH_D saturation. Tripled bottoms valve size (adjusted LCs). LCH_D gain: 1->20
- BIDIR2_3 (SIMPLE_7_3): mod BIDIR2_2... CCL_B (Qreb) saturation following CCH_B. Doubled distillate valve size. Reduced Qreb max from 2->1.4. Increased CCH_B gain from 1->10. Changed CCH_B active condition from 99\% water to 99.9\% water due to the controller settling at 99\% (CCL gave up).
- BIDIR2_4
